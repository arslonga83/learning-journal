    summary: "Sometimes when you are really talented at one specific thing, it is tough to see other career paths as options.",
    text: "Growing up I had a talent for playing the piano and organ, so when it came time to choose a college path, it seemed pretty obvious that I should pursue music. I have lots of great memories and experiences to look back on after 20 years, but also see lots of Sunday mornings and nights that I was working and missing fun times with my family. It's hard to consider those outcomes as a 13 year-old!"

    summary: "The pandemic was a struggle in many respects, but also reignited my love of learning new things.",
    text: "At the start of the pandemic, the church where I was working closed its doors and we were asked to figure out how to offer virtual music to the congregation. This started me on a journey of discovery, from early cell phone videos to later edited productions including voices, organ, brass quintet, and percussion, all recorded separately from the musician's homes. I spent more time at my computer than I had since college, and taught myself all sorts of new skills using Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro. This reignited my love of tech and learning new things...'oh right, I like other things besides music!'"

    title: "Let's explore some learning options",
    summary: "It turns out there are about a million different people online claiming to be the best way to learn how to code.",
    text: "Once I came up with the idea to shift careers into tech, I quickly realized I had a <strong>lot</strong> to learn. I considered all the options, including going back to school or attending a fancy bootcamp, but with a full-time job that I needed to keep to help pay the mortgage, I decided a self-taught path was going to be best. Initially I explored some Udemy Courses and worked my way through much of The Odin Project, but neither of these quite fit my learning style. The Odin Project is largely learning by reading and then 'figure it out'. I learned a lot but spent a lot of the time questioning my code - even if it worked I was worried I was picking up bad habits. The video tutorials on Udemy had the opposite problem - I felt good following along but wasn't being forced to struggle through problems on my own."

    title: "Enter Scrimba",
    summary: "After following a link for 'extra content' in The Odin Project, I stumbled upon my ideal mix of learning styles.",
    text: "Following a link in the React Section of The Odin Project introduced me to Scrimba. I quickly fell in love with the format, which lets you click right into the example and write your own code, and then get <em>immediate</em> feedback on the teacher\'s recommended approach to the problem. It did not take long to decide this was the learning method for me, and I signed up as a Pro Member on the Frontend Career Path. I decided it was worth starting from scratch, even though I had already learned much of what was being covered in early modules. It reinforced my previous learning and filled in many gaps. I'm so glad I found it!"

    title: "Restaurant Ordering App",
    summary: "I made this Restaurant Ordering App as a solo project in the Frontend Career Path.",
    text: "One of my favorite parts of the Scrimba courses is the included Solo Projects. These give you a chance to flex your newly acquired skills, and work through all the inevitable issues that will come up along the way. They also include a Figma design file that serves as a model, which adds a level of real-world experience to the project. I can imagine one day working as a front-end developer and having the design team send over a file like this and say, 'here\'s what we want our website to look like. Build it!' Other than the that file, everything is built from scratch, and the code is all my own. I was pretty excited as I actually got all the features to work!"

    title: "Learning Journal Project....that's this one!",
    summary: "This website is actually one of the solo projects, with an emphasis on responsive design.",
    text: "Another thing I love about the Scrimba Courses is how they strive to keep things up to date in a quickly changing world. This website you are viewing right now was part of the 'responsive design' section. It uses media queries, flexbox, and relative units for font sizes and margins to keep everything looking great on any sized screen. It was great to be able to practice all of these ideas on one site built from scratch, and personalize it with my own content. Thanks for reading!"
