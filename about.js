    <h1>Hello! My name is Jeff. Welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
    <p>After several months exploring different courses and tutorials online, I discovered Scrimba and started working my way through the Frontend Career Path. This site is one of the solo projects - it represents an approximate halfway point in the modules, and serves to showcase some of the things I've learned.</p>

  <h4>How did I get here?</h4>
  <p>After more than 20 years as a performing musician, I rediscovered a love of tech when I found myself working from home during the pandemic and learning the skills needed to record, edit, and produce weekly virtual music videos for my job. </p>
  <p>I have a life-long love of learning (some would describe me as a serial hobbyist) and I'm excited to embark on a new career path where I can keep learning new things in a contantly changing field.</p>
  <h4>What are my goals?</h4>
  <p>I want to keep learning new skills. I feel that I can reach a point where I'm qualified to apply for coding jobs.</p>
  <p>I'm also realistic, and don't expect to be single-handedly coding the next Facebook in the next few months. I hope to find an entry-level position with a great team of colleagues who I can learn from as I begin my new career.</p>
